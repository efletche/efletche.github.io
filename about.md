Hello everybody, my name is Eric Fletcher. 

I am currently working as a Computer and Database Specialist with the Joint Institute of Marine and Atmospheric Research (JIMAR). I assist with fisheries stock researchers in the Pacific Island Regional Science Center (PIFSC) in various projects such as supporting data visualization for research working papers and publications, improving fisheries stock assessment related tools.   

I am also a member [Nu'uanu](https://www.nuuanutoastmasters.org/) and [Ford Island](https://sites.google.com/site/fordislandtoastmasters/home) Toastmasters. For 2018-2019, I served as [Area 11 Director](https://district49.org/district-leaders/) of the [Hawaii's Toastmasters District](https://district49.org/).
